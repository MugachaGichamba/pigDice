## Description
Two persons visiting the website will be required to enter their names after which the game will begin. Each player will take turns rolling the dice and whatever they score will be added to their current score unless they roll a "1" or press the hold button. If they roll a 1, the current score will be reset to zero and the next player will play. If they press the hold button their current score will be added to their total score and it will be the other players turn to play. The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.
